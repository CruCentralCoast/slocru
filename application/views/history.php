                As a caring community, our heart is to see people
                drawn together. Through these communities,
                our hope is that people will help each other to
                develop, encourage one another, and provide
                places where people can share anything, without
                fear of judgment. This type of community is
                transformational and life-changing. We do this
                through large group meetings, smaller Community
                Groups where people can be known, and through
                events focused on personal development or
                having fun together.

                We are also passionate about connecting people to
                Jesus Christ. As a missions organization, our DNA
                is desiring to see people experience Jesus. We train
                and equip people to have conversations with friends,
                family, and coworkers, and we mentor people
                toward having a healthy relationship with the Lord
                where they are comfortable stepping out in faith.
                We send students out to places like Santa Monica
                for a summer mission, and around the world as
                missionaries for a summer, a year, or long-term. Our
                hope is that God would use our movements to bring
                about hope and change throughout the world as
                people encounter and experience Jesus.

                Cru Cal Poly SLO
            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">
                As one of the 12 movements of Cru Central Coast, 
                Cru at Cal Poly SLO (San Luis Obispo) focuses on 
                students attending Cal Poly. Through the 800+ students
                involved in our large group meeting and in our Community 
                Groups, we really do hope to give everyone at Cal Poly a
                chance to hear about Jesus. <br /><br />
                But our movement has not always been this large. In fact,
                just rewinding back to 1997, you can see what we were then 
                and where we are now. God brought about incredible growth 
                and change to make this happen. It wasnâ€™t Cru that caused 
                any of it. As Cal Poly went quarter to quarter from 2001-2003,
                numbers almost doubled each quarter. From 40 to 80, 150, 300, 
                600, all the way to 800-1000 students in the span of just a 
                few years. God did much and we just tried to keep up.<br /><br />
                Even as our numbers grew, we quickly recognized that not all
                pockets of campus were involved in this growth. We were 
                under-represented by athletes and faculty and ethnic-minority 
                groups to name a few. So as we looked to reach every student 
                and faculty, we realized we weren't going to do so through one
                group. We started looking to establish places where different
                groups of people could be welcomed and accepted.

                The first of these groups was Epic, our ministry to Asian-Americans.
                Through a Cru staff member and a single student who started praying 
                together in 2003, God eventually helped to launch this movement in 
                2007. With 70-100 students now, God is using Epic to reach out to Cal
                Poly SLO through Asian-American students. He wasn't done there though.

                In 2008, movements were launched at Cuesta Community College and
                in the Greek system (fraternities and sororities) at Cal Poly. 
                These new movements expanded our scope and brought us into new 
                pockets that were previously untouched.<br /><br />
                In 2011, Athletes in Action started with a movement focused on 
                collegiate and club athletes at Cal Poly as well as Faculty 
                Commons with a movement focused on reaching professors and faculty.<br /><br />
                In 2012, Destino launched with a focus on Latino/Hispanic students at Cal Poly.<br /><br />
                In 2013, Branded launched with a focus on Ag majors at Cal Poly.<br /><br />
                In 2014, Cru High launched at San Luis Obispo High School opening up yet another campus.<br /><br />
                In 2015, movements were launched at Cuesta North in Paso Robles and Allan-Hancock
                in Santa Maria. We now had movements on 5 campuses. In addition, a movement
                started amongst the ROTC students at Cal Poly, which we now call Valor.<br /><br />

                God continues to open new doors and new places for us to walk into. As we continue
                forward, we recognize all that God has done, but also the places God has yet to
                bring us. We are 12 movements focused on reaching the entirety of the Central Coast.
                And we are a single family doing this together. Together, we are Cru Central Coast.<br /><br />
