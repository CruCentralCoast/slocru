                <p>SLO Cru believes that Community Group Bible
                    studies are one of the most eff ective ways to 
                    get involved and integrated into the community 
                    of believers here on the Central Coast and learn 
                    more about your faith in God in the process.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>In order to foster a natural and comfortable 
                    environment, students are grouped with their 
                    peers and organized based on gender, year, 
                    dorm (or other housing), and other interests.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Through small groups, current leaders are able 
                    to invest in the lives of their students through 
                    weekly study and discussion of God's Word, 
                    individual and group Discipleship relationships, 
                    training and equipping on Evangelism and world 
                    missions, and preparing future leaders for roles 
                    within Cru Central Coast's various ministries.</p>
