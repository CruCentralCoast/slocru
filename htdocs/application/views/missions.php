        <p class="summer">Whether it's a prayer walk on a campus in Asia,
            <br>a conversation about Jesus in a coffee shop in 
            <br>Europe, or a night of worship on a sandy beach 
            <br>in the States, a Summer Mission with Cru is your 
            <br>opportunity to make your summer extraordinary.
            <br>
            <br>Imagine a summer that could transform cities, 
            <br>countries, and continents around the globe while 
            <br>also changing your life - a summer that propels 
            <br>you into a deeper walk with God and gives you 
            <br>greater confidence in making Christ known; a 
            <br>summer that develops your leadership skills and 
            <br>begins friendships that will last a lifetime.

        <p class="stint">Through a one-year internship called STINT, 
            <br>thousands of Cru students and recent graduates 
            <br>have taken the life-changing message of Jesus' 
            <br>love and forgiveness to students in places like East 
            <br>Asia and the Middle East. However, millions still 
            <br>need to hear. Will you be part of continuing to 
            <br>take the gospel to every campus, every nation?
            <br>
            <br>Right now, on campuses around the globe, lost 
            <br>students are ready to take the next step toward a 
            <br>relationship with God. They are simply waiting for 
            <br>someone to show them how. Is God calling you to 
            <br>go? Will you be the one to show them?
