            Cru (formerly Campus Crusade for Christ) is an interdenominational
            worldwide Christian ministry. It's our goal to give every student
            the opportunity to hear the good news of Jesus Christ.                      
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            With over a thousand students involved in our ministry, we have many
            opportunities to make friends and share Jesus through bible studies,
            social events, discipleship relationships, short-term missions
            trips, and weekly meetings. Check out our upcoming
