            Cru (formerly Campus Crusade for Christ) is an interdenominational
            worldwide Christian ministry. It's our goal to give every student
            the opportunity to hear the good news of Jesus Christ.

            With over a thousand students involved in our ministry, we have many
            opportunities to make friends and share Jesus through bible studies,
            social events, discipleship relationships, short-term missions
            trips, and weekly meetings. Check out our upcoming
